# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning: A Geometric Intuition Guide

Most of us learnt linear algebra backwards. we started with symbols.

- Vectors are introduced as columns of numbers.
- Matrices are grids of numbers.
- Multiplication becomes a mechanical procedure.

And somewhere along the way, the meaning disappears.

Linear algebra was never meant to be about numbers on a page. It is about how space itself can be stretched, rotated, compressed, and reshaped. Every matrix is not just an arrangement of numbers - it is an action. It takes the space you live in and transforms it. Once you see that, the formulas stop being something to memorize. They become something you recognize.

And this is exactly why linear algebra sits at the heart of machine learning. Neural networks, embeddings, attention mechanisms - all of them are, at their core, sequences of geometric transformations applied to space.

This article is about Explaining myself - rebuilding linear algebra from that perspective. Not as arithmetic, but as geometry. 

Lets follow the below roadmap.
